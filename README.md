# Theme

The theme of YouTube Blue is really fancy, and really blue *(Note: the theme can be buggy, if you don't use youtube dark mode)*. This was created by [TheLegendOfWolf_](https://userstyles.org/users/956934 "The UserStyles profile of TheLegendOfWolf_") and it's available for free [here](https://userstyles.org/styles/195233/blue-youtube-by-thelegendofwolf-3683) *(Note: the CSS doesn't exactly match because I edited it to be compatible outside a userscript manager)*.

# Ad-Blocking

YouTube Blue's adblocker works like magic. Thanks for the [idea](https://dev.to/penge/chrome-extension-that-skips-youtube-ads-steps-how-to-create-it-3ibp#3-how-skip-ad-works).

# Picture in Picture (PiP) mode

Picture in Picture (PiP) mode is just awesome (but it's buggy sometimes :D). It combines the [`HTMLVideoElement.requestPictureInPicture()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement/requestPictureInPicture) function with [ipcMain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-process) and [] usertasks. You can enter Picture in Picture mode by right-clicking the taskbar icon of YouTube Blue, then clicking "Request Picture in Picture (PiP) mode".



# Video Downloading

Video downloading in YouTube Blue is really fast, and high quality. It uses ~~[ytdl-core](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) integrated into NodeJS~~ [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) (for high-quality downloading), some command-line tweaks, and Electron usertasks. You can download the current video by right-clicking the taskbar icon of YouTube Blue and selecting the "Download current video" option.

# About me

Hi! My name is PiciAkk, and I'm a Hungarian student. I made YouTube Blue in a weekend just for fun, but I maintained it later. I code in a few languages, including Python, and NodeJS. If my English is bad, it is because I'm Hungarian, and I only learn English in a self-taught way.

**Thanks for reading! Good video watching!**
